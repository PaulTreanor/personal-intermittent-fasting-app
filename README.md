# Intermittent fasting app

A personal tool to help me track intermittent fasting.

It lets you track fasting and eating windows with a countdown. 

You can set your fasting and eating window times and it will store them in local storage, and then it tells you what you're supposed to be doing along with a countdown. 

## Todo 
- [ ] Integrate with Google Sheets (or something like that) for some sort of db
- [ ] Add a heatmap so I can see some idea of progress and consistency in my habit
